Hello Everyone,

This is an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting student performance based on demographic and academic factors. The project includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment via a Flask web application. Key findings may include insights into the influence of various factors like parental education, test preparation, and lunch type on student scores. Data pipelines involve preprocessing student data, including handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and training predictive models such as decision trees or ensemble methods. The Flask web application allows users to input student information and receive predictions regarding academic performance.

The project uses data pipelines to prepare and analyze student data. These pipelines handle tasks like cleaning data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. By organizing these steps into pipelines, the code ensures efficient and consistent processing of data for model training and prediction.
